## How your website accomplished each item in the criteria.
- Most of the concepts have been used in the website. The basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have been used and the Intermediate JavaScript such as DOM Manipulation and Fetch API has also been used.
- Since we have found that Twitter is bland, we want to make it a little aesthetically pleasing with cleaniness on browsing the website in mind when navigating the interface.

## How you worked as a team to accomplish the project
- Since we are only two people, the division of tasks between us is clear. One of us is responsible for the UI Design and the other is responsible for the API Integration of the website.
- We tried to minimize the conflict in changing code by having communication to each other that there is a commited action; either adding, modifying, or removing some lines of code.
- We could improve the website in the future by making the integration more efficient and to make the animations of the UI smoother.
